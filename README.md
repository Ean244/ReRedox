## Terminal v1

Terminal is a ergonomic split keyboard design modified from the [Redox Project](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) by [Mattia Dal Ben (aka u/TiaMaT102)](mailto:matthewdibi@gmail.com).

Key modifications include:

* Replacement of 1.25U keycaps with 1.5U keycaps (which are easier to find / typically found in keycap sets)
* Adding two OLED panels with WPM counter and custom pixel art
* Changing shape of through-holes for the switches the from irregular shapes to regular ones
  * Some board manufacturers do not accept irregular shapes (for me it was JLCPB)
* Adding support stands for a 6 degree tilt

A [sandwich transparent acrylic casing](https://github.com/Ean244/Terminal-Acrylic-Casing) was designed for Terminal v1.
